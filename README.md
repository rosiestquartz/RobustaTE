RobustaTE is a basic graphical text editor written in Java, and using Java Swing for its UI. It's inspired by projects such as SciTE, Notepad++, Kate and Gedit.

This has mainly started as a project for me to revise/improve my aging Java knowledge, and learn more about building a UI in Swing.

Functionality is currently very limited, but is being improved with time. Current functionality includes:
  - Saving a text file to disk, from either a new file or an existing one
  - Opening an existing text file and editing it
  - Changing the font size of the currently open file
  - Opening multiple files and editor windows

Any contributions to features or bug fixes are greatly appreciated! :)
